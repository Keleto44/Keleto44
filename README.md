# About Me ‚ö∞Ô∏è
Now it's time to tell a little about myself) Hi everyone! My moniker: Keleto44, and no, I'm not 44 years old)))) I'm a developer and devops engineer and of course a validator. My main language is Go lang. While I was writing my websites and other solutions in Go, I got interested in web3 and then it started. I started to get deeper and deeper into decentralization. Of course, this is our future! I set myself the task to find cool projects and try to help them with development. The more cool ideas we have, the faster web3 will move around the planet! Join me on my social networks and let's make this world safer!
